# T2D_str_pr

The computer codes for the protocol submitted to the Cell Press/STAR Protocols as 'A protocol and software implementation for analyzing emergence dynamics of diabetes with obesity using numerical continuation and bifurcation analysis'.

model.ode: The ode file that can be run in XPP/AUTO dynamical system analysis and simulation toolbox (https://sites.pitt.edu/~phase/bard/bardware/xpp/xpp.html).

model_bif.ode : The ode file that can be used for generating the bifurcation diagram of the system using BMI as the bifurcation parameter.

model.py: The Python code that defines the parameter values and the ode function that defines the mathematical formulations.

xpp2python.py: Module for exporting model data from XPPAUT to Python, and creating a Python executable script for the model.

dynamics.py : Module for analysis and visualization.

bifurcation_data.dat : Bifurcation diagram data.

molde.ode.pars : Data file that contains model data exported from XPPAUT.

animation.gif : A representative animation generated by the dynamics.animation function.
